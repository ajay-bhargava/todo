# Rule Name: convex-optimistic-debounce

## Description
Guidelines for using debouncing and optimistic UI updates with Convex routes, especially in websocket-driven UIs.

---

## Convex Optimistic UI & Debounce Rules

### 1. Optimistic UI Updates
- Always update local UI state immediately in response to user actions (e.g., marking a todo as completed, editing text) before awaiting the result of a Convex mutation.
- Use local state (e.g., React's `useState`) to reflect changes instantly, providing a responsive user experience.
- After the mutation completes, reconcile the local state with the server state if needed (e.g., reset optimistic state on error or after successful fetch).

### 2. Debouncing Convex Mutations
- For any user input that can trigger frequent updates (e.g., typing in a todo, toggling completion), wrap Convex mutation calls in a debounced function.
- Use a custom `useDebouncedCallback` hook or similar utility to ensure that rapid user actions do not result in excessive network requests.
- The debounce delay should be tuned for the UX (e.g., 300â€“500ms for text input, shorter for toggles).

### 3. Pure Functions & Stable References
- Prefer pure, stable callback functions for debounced handlers to avoid unnecessary re-renders and to ensure correct closure behavior.
- Avoid using mutable refs or hash maps for tracking pending updates unless absolutely necessary; local state and debounced callbacks should suffice for most cases.

### 4. Convex Websocket Model
- Convex uses websockets for real-time updates. Optimistic UI and debounced mutations work well with this model, as server state will be pushed to the client when it changes.
- Do not block UI updates on server round-trips; trust the websocket to eventually synchronize state.

### 5. Visual Feedback for Optimistic State
- When applying optimistic updates (e.g., marking a todo as completed), visually indicate the change immediately (e.g., strike-through, dim text).
- Use conditional class names or styles based on local optimistic state, not just server state.

### 6. Error Handling
- If a Convex mutation fails, revert the optimistic update and notify the user as appropriate.
- Keep error handling logic close to the mutation call for clarity.

### 7. Example Pattern
```tsx
// Pseudocode for a debounced, optimistic update pattern
const [optimisticState, setOptimisticState] = useState(...);
const mutation = useMutation(api.someMutation);

const debouncedMutation = useDebouncedCallback((args) => {
  mutation(args);
}, 500);

const handleUserAction = (args) => {
  setOptimisticState(...); // update UI immediately
  debouncedMutation(args); // send to server after debounce
};
```

### 8. Example Functions to Use

Function debouncing.

```tsx
/**
 * Creates a debounced version of a function that delays its execution until after
 * a specified delay has passed since the last time it was called.
 *
 * @template Args - The argument types of the function to debounce
 * @param fn - The function to debounce
 * @param delay - The delay in milliseconds to wait before executing the function
 * @returns A new function that will only execute after the specified delay has passed
 *          since its last invocation
 *
 * @example
 * const debouncedSearch = debounce((query: string) => {
 *   // Perform search with query
 * }, 300);
 *
 * // Only the last call within 300ms will execute
 * debouncedSearch("a");
 * debouncedSearch("ap");
 * debouncedSearch("app"); // Only this call will execute
 */
export function debounce<Args extends unknown[]>(
	fn: (...args: Args) => void,
	delay: number,
): (...args: Args) => void {
	let timer: ReturnType<typeof setTimeout>;
	return (...args: Args) => {
		clearTimeout(timer);
		timer = setTimeout(() => fn(...args), delay);
	};
}
```

Debounced Callback.

```tsx
// apps/web/src/functions/useDebouncedCallback.ts
import { useCallback, useRef } from "react";
import { debounce } from "./debounce";

/**
 * A React hook that creates a debounced version of a callback function.
 * The debounced function will only execute after the specified delay has passed
 * since its last invocation.
 *
 * @template Args - The argument types of the callback function
 * @param fn - The callback function to debounce
 * @param delay - The delay in milliseconds to wait before executing the function
 * @returns A memoized debounced version of the callback function
 *
 * @example
 * const debouncedSearch = useDebouncedCallback((query: string) => {
 *   // Perform search with query
 * }, 300);
 *
 * // Only the last call within 300ms will execute
 * debouncedSearch("a");
 * debouncedSearch("ap");
 * debouncedSearch("app"); // Only this call will execute
 */
export function useDebouncedCallback<Args extends unknown[]>(
	fn: (...args: Args) => void,
	delay: number,
): (...args: Args) => void {
	const fnRef = useRef(fn);
	fnRef.current = fn;

	// Only create the debounced function once
	const debounced = useRef(
		debounce((...args: Args) => fnRef.current(...args), delay),
	);

	return useCallback((...args: Args) => {
		debounced.current(...args);
	}, []);
}
```

**Summary:**  
When building with Convex, always prefer optimistic UI updates and debounce mutation calls for user-driven, high-frequency actions. This approach leverages Convex's websocket model for real-time sync and ensures a fast, responsive user experience.
